To play the music for the soundtrack, click on the moving deer.

The river is a video of ocean waves which takes a little to load since videos tend to be large files.

Sometimes the scene can be glitchy in the browser due to fact I used many imported objects.
I've found aframe doesn't really like chrome, so try using a browser other than chrome if it doesn't load up properly on chrome.
Or just click on the deer multiple times or reopen the project.
