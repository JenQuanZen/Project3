To play the music for the soundtrack, click on the moving deer.

The river is a video of ocean waves which takes a little to load since videos tend to be large files.

Sometimes the scene can be glitchy in the browser due to fact I used many imported objects.
So just click on the deer multiple times or reopen the project.
